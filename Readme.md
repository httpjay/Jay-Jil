Aim:
This project focuses on detecting fake reviews from e-commerce websites using machine learning models. It involves processing, cleaning, and extracting features from textual data to classify reviews as FAKE or REAL. The dataset consists of user reviews labeled as either FAKE or REAL.

Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language for data processing, machine learning, and model evaluation.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
NLTK: Natural Language Processing (NLP) library for text tokenization and stopword removal.
Pickle: For model serialization and saving the trained models.
Dataset
The dataset consists of e-commerce product reviews labeled as FAKE or REAL, containing the following columns:

category: Product category.
rating: Numerical rating (1-5 scale).
label: Class label indicating whether the review is fake or real.
text_: The actual review text.
The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing data.

Steps in the Project

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Load the dataset and perform basic data cleaning.
Clean review text by removing HTML tags, special characters, and converting it to lowercase.
Tokenization using NLTK library and removing stopwords.

2. Feature Extraction
Use TF-IDF Vectorization to transform the cleaned text into numerical features, with a limit of 5000 features.

3. Model Training and Evaluation
Train multiple classifiers, including:

Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Passive-Aggressive Classifier
Voting Classifier (combining multiple classifiers for better accuracy)
Stacking Classifier (combining base models with a final estimator)
Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Tune the Naive Bayes classifier’s regularization parameter (alpha) and other classifiers’ parameters to improve model performance.

5. Model Interpretability
Extract top positive and negative words from the Naive Bayes model using the feature_log_prob_ attribute.
Plot frequent words for each class (Fake/Real) to help understand model behavior.

6. Model Comparison
Compare the models based on precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Investigate misclassified reviews to identify areas for further improvement.

7. Model Deployment (Future Work)
Model Deployment (Frontend): Integrate the trained models into a user-facing application (e.g., a web app) where users can submit reviews and get predictions (Fake/Real).

Future Work:
Real-Time Fake Review Detection System:
The next step is to develop a web-based system that integrates with e-commerce platforms to classify reviews in real-time as either computer-generated (bot) or original (OR). This system will automatically process new reviews, providing immediate feedback and helping to filter fake reviews on e-commerce sites. The model will be optimized for scalability, ensuring it performs efficiently on larger datasets and in real-time environments. The interface will be user-friendly, allowing administrators to view results and trends easily. Additionally, the model will be adapted to work across multiple platforms and product categories, with ongoing improvements using advanced techniques like deep learning for better accuracy and generalization.
