Aim:
This project focuses on detecting fake reviews from e-commerce websites using machine learning models. The task involves processing textual data, cleaning it, extracting features, and applying various classifiers to determine if a review is fake or real. The dataset consists of user reviews labeled as FAKE or REAL.

Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for data processing, machine learning, and model evaluation.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
NLTK: Natural language processing library used for text tokenization and stopword removal.
XGBoost: Gradient boosting library used for model training.


Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a collection of e-commerce product reviews, labeled as FAKE or REAL. The dataset includes the following columns:
category: Product category.
rating: The numerical rating (1 to 5 scale).
label: Class label indicating whether the review is fake or real.
text_: The actual review text.
The dataset has been split into 80% training data and 20% testing data.


Steps in the Project

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Load the dataset and perform basic data cleaning.
The review text is cleaned by removing HTML tags, special characters, and converting to lowercase.
Tokenization is done using the NLTK library, followed by removing stopwords.

2. Feature Extraction
The cleaned text is transformed into a numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization (with a limit of 5000 features).

3. Model Training and Evaluation
Different classifiers are trained on the dataset, including:
Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Passive-Aggressive Classifier

4. Hyperparameter Tuning
The Naive Bayes classifier's regularization parameter (alpha) is tuned to find the best performing value.

5. Model Interpretability
Top positive and negative words are extracted from the Naive Bayes model using the feature_log_prob_ attribute.
Frequent words for each class (Fake/Real) are plotted for better understanding.

Future Work
Model Comparison: Compare performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Error Analysis: Investigate misclassified reviews to identify patterns for further model improvement.
Model Deployment: Develop a user interface to display predictions and provide an easy-to-use experience for the users.
Model Deployment (Frontend): Once the models are trained and evaluated, the next step is to integrate them into a user-facing application (e.g., web app) to allow users to submit reviews and receive predictions (Fake/Real).
